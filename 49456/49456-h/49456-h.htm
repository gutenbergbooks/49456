<h2>A Picture of Uncle Sam</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Best of all the cartoons which both reveal and point the way
in our national existence, and certainly the best among the
symbols which represent great nations, stands Uncle Sam. In
no other representative character is personality so clearly
defined; in no other is the range of expression and of action so great.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>Inexhaustible are his activities, and of endless variety the moments of
thought and of action in which the soul of the nation has been thus
caught and fixed. Uncle Sam, farmer, householder, and landed proprietor,
has domestic responsibilities upon a scale never known before. One
sees him, too complacently,&mdash;in a rich-Jonathan moment,&mdash;riding the
reapers and gathering in inexhaustible harvests; one sees him waking
sleepily from a Rip-van-Winkle drowsiness, to guard his forests and
waterfalls from despoiling hands; or, with a face less firm than it should
have been, settling a dispute among the children, perhaps in a threatened
nation-wide strike. There is often a fatherly or grandfatherly touch
about him; guardian of western lands and seas, he has not only his own
but his step-children to look after.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>One cannot touch the many aspects of his whimsical, doubting, determined,
sensitive face. Nearly the whole range of human feeling, of
human expression is there.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>Honestly he tries to secure a right balancing of the scales of justice for
his multifarious offspring, yet often finds this delicate adjustment puzzling
beyond his power to endure. Swift are the changes whereby his
Hamlet moments of indecision slip into his Napoleonic moments of
great deeds. Something of woman’s intuition is in him, and sometimes,
too, woman’s over-ready action in the line of eager and sudden conviction;
yet again, sinewy, virile, he shows the muscles stiffening along his
arm, and he is become the very incarnation of lean and powerful masculinity,
moving determinedly to a goal seen steadily from the beginning.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Our country maintains an Army and a Navy to fight
against human beings with whom we are occasionally
at war. In the fight against two far more
dangerous and insidious foes with whom we are
<i>always</i> at war&mdash;Disease and Ignorance&mdash;our doctors have the
aid and guidance of the United States Public Health Service
and our schools that of the United States
Bureau of Education. These Federal
institutions are aided, respectively, by
state and local boards of health and by
state and local boards of education.</p>

<p>The Public Health Service, which is a
branch of the Treasury Department, was
formerly called the Marine Hospital Service,
and was originally devoted only to
caring for sick and disabled seamen of the
American merchant marine. Today it is
safeguarding the health of everybody in
the country. It maintains quarantine
stations and offices for the medical inspection
of immigrants at the principal seaports;
establishes domestic quarantines,
when necessary, to prevent the spread of
disease from state to state; investigates
and suppresses epidemics; collects and
publishes health statistics; makes elaborate
studies of important diseases, such as
hookworm disease, malaria, pellagra, trachoma,
typhoid fever, and tuberculosis;
investigates public water supplies and sewage;
carries on research in regard to school,
mental and industrial hygiene; and, last but
not least, educates the people in hygiene
and sanitation by distributing tons of literature,
holding exhibits, giving lectures,
lending lantern-slides, et cetera. During
a recent outbreak of influenza the Public
Health Service distributed 6,000,000
leaflets in regard to the disease. A new
duty of the Service is to operate hospitals
for the physical restoration and re-education
of discharged soldiers disabled in the
World War. The Service has established a
Sanitary Reserve Corps, consisting of
medical men and others who are available
for active duty in time of national emergency.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Education, which is
under the Department of the Interior, is
the national clearing-house of information
on educational subjects. This information
is set forth in a large number of valuable
publications, and the Bureau also maintains
a corps of experts who travel about
the country giving advice and conducting
investigations in regard to various lines of
education. One of the duties of this
Bureau is to supervise the expenditure of
the liberal funds provided by the Government
toward the support of agricultural
and mechanical colleges, commonly known
as the “land-grant colleges.” Another is
to operate schools for the education of
native children in Alaska and to look after
the Government reindeer industry in that
territory. A comparatively recent undertaking
is the promotion of home gardening
under school direction in cities and towns
throughout the country, and the organization
of a School Garden Army, which has
materially increased the national food-supply.</p>

<p>Another educational agency of the Government
is the Federal Board for Vocational
Education, which was organized in
the year 1917. This Board directs a
scheme of cooperation between the Federal
Government and the states for the
promotion of vocational education in the
fields of agriculture, home economics and
the industrial arts. Congress has made
liberal appropriations for this work, and
these are to be increased annually until
they amount to $7,367,000 a year. Each
state is required to spend as much for
vocational education as it receives from
the national Government for the same
purpose. Before this plan was inaugurated,
the training of young people at public
expense for definite trades and industries
had made little progress in the United
States. Since the World War the Board
has had charge of the training and education
of discharged and disabled soldiers
and sailors. This work is carried on in
the various technical, trade and commercial
schools of the country, or other institutions
offering special courses, and also
directly in the trades and industries. It
is not limited to manual training. The
Board has announced that “all careers are
open to the disabled men.”</p>

<p>This educational work must not be
confused with that carried on for discharged
soldiers in the hospitals conducted
by the Public Health Service,
and for soldiers still in service in the
Army hospitals.</p>

<p class="dropcap">It would take a good-sized library to tell adequately
all the things the Department of Agriculture is doing
for the people of the United States. A formal
program issued each year sets forth in barest outlines
the undertakings on which the Department is engaged.
Although only a few brief paragraphs are devoted to each
project, one of these “Programs of Work”
fills about 600 pages of fine print.</p>

<p>This Department is devoted to the two-fold
task of gathering and disseminating
information; primarily for the benefit of
farmers, but also, directly or indirectly,
for that of every man, woman and child in
this country. It is also charged with the
duty of administering various laws designed
to safeguard the health and welfare
of the people. Under this head come the
inspection of food and drugs, meat inspection,
protection of useful birds and animals,
supervision of the national forests,
and a host of other useful activities.</p>

<p>Let us set down at random some of the
astonishingly varied tasks with which the
Department has lately been occupied.
Last year nearly sixty million animals were
slaughtered for food under the inspection
of the Bureau of Animal Industry. The Biological
Survey treated more than thirteen
million acres of land with poisoned grain to
destroy rodent pests. The Bureau of Crop
Estimates published monthly data obtained
from an army of about two hundred
thousand volunteer crop reporters.
The Bureau of Public Roads administered
the Federal-Aid Road Act of July 11, 1916,
under which the Government is to cooperate
with the states in road-building by
means of appropriations which began
with $5,000,000 for the year 1916, and will
increase annually by $5,000,000 to $25,000,000
for the year 1921. The Bureau of
Soils continued its work of mapping and
classifying the soils, which work now extends
over nearly a million square miles.
The Weather Bureau established new
observing stations in the West Indies, to
keep a lookout for hurricanes, and added
the study of volcanic phenomena to its
wide range of scientific undertakings. The
Federal Horticultural Board conducted an
immense campaign to rid the cotton-growing
regions of the country of the pink boll-worm.
The Department as a whole led a
nation-wide effort to provide means of
feeding a hungry world. In a single
year the area planted with agricultural
crops was increased by 22,000,000 acres.
In 1918 the planted area amounted
to 289,000,000 acres. During the same
year the country produced about nineteen
and a half billion pounds of meat:
an increase of about four billion pounds
since 1914.</p>

<p>A branch of the Department known as
the States Relations Service is engaged in
educational work on a vast scale. All over
the country its “county agents” are giving
direct instruction and advice to the farmers.
There are about twenty-four hundred of these
officials now in the field, besides 1,700
“home demonstration agents,” who help
the farmers’ wives to solve their domestic
problems. Farm work is made interesting
and profitable to the rising generation by
means of some forty different kinds of
clubs, such as Pig Clubs, Corn Clubs,
Canning Clubs and Poultry Clubs, in
which are enrolled more than two million
boys and girls.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Department is by far the
largest publisher of agricultural information
in the world. Last year it issued
over twenty-five hundred documents of
all kinds, in editions aggregating nearly
one hundred million copies. Included in
this stupendous flood of literature were
millions of copies of Farmers’ Bulletins,
distributed free of charge, and each devoted
to some practical topic connected with
rural life and industries.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The Department of Commerce, the Federal Trade
Commission, the Federal Reserve Board, the Interstate
Commerce Commission, the Bureau of Markets,
the Shipping Board, and many other agencies of the
Federal Government are engaged in promoting and regulating
the commercial business of the country. The Bureau of
Foreign and Domestic Commerce, a branch
of the Department of Commerce, collects
information about foreign markets for
American goods from American consuls,
commercial attachés stationed at the principal
foreign capitals, and a corps of traveling
special agents. The Bureau issues a
daily newspaper called <i>Commerce Reports</i>,
containing notes and articles of commercial
interest from all parts of the world and a
list of “Foreign Trade Opportunities.”
Each of these “opportunities” for American
business in some foreign country is set
forth in a brief paragraph. The following
are examples:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>29267.*&mdash;Chemicals, and equipment and supplies
for electroplating work are required by a firm in
Denmark. Correspondence may be in English.
Reference.</p>

<p>29268.*&mdash;A company in India desires to purchase
and secure an agency for the sale of steel and
iron in bars, sheets, tubes, plates, etc.; builders’
and engineers’ hardware; caustic soda; and petroleum
and lubricating oils. References.</p>

<p>29269.*&mdash;The purchase of plywood and veneers in
all thicknesses and sizes is desired by a man in
England. Terms, credit preferred, or will pay
cash against documents. References.</p></div>

<p>An American manufacturer or exporter
who is interested in one of these notices
can obtain the address of the foreign concern
that desires goods, agencies, etc., by
writing to the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic
Commerce, in Washington. The
Bureau maintains district offices in several
large American cities. At the New York
office, which is in the Custom House, there
is a permanent exhibit of samples showing
the various kinds of foreign-made goods
sold in the principal importing countries of
the world. The exhibits, after being shown
first in New York, are usually shown in the
principal centers of the particular industry
concerned. Special exhibits of samples are
also held in connection with trade conventions.
Apart from <i>Commerce Reports</i>, the
Bureau publishes an immense amount of
statistical information concerning the foreign
commerce of the United States and
foreign tariffs, and also extensive studies
of foreign markets for particular lines of
goods.</p>

<p>The other bureaus of the Department of
Commerce are the Bureau of Standards,
which facilitates commerce by regulating
weights and measures and by carrying on
scientific research relating to all the manufacturing
industries; the Bureau of the
Census, which compiles elaborate statistics
concerning trade and industry, as well
as those relating to population; the Bureau
of Fisheries, which has immensely stimulated
trade in fishery products; and four
bureaus which aid, protect and regulate
navigation&mdash;the Bureau of Lighthouses,
the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Steamboat-Inspection
Service, and the Bureau
of Navigation.</p>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission is
charged with the duty of preventing various
abuses in interstate business, especially
in the nature of unlawful trusts and
combinations. The Federal Reserve Board
supervises the affairs of the twelve Federal
Reserve Banks, and indirectly exercises a
certain amount of control over the banking
system of the country. The Interstate
Commerce Commission regulates interstate
transportation, controls freight rates
and passenger fares, and promotes the
safety of travel by prescribing rules concerning
equipment and methods of operation.
The Bureau of Markets of the
Department of Agriculture promotes business
in all kinds of agricultural products,
and maintains a market news service.
The Shipping Board, which was established
in 1916, is engaged in the very
important work of building up the American
merchant marine.</p>

<p>The Pan American Union, a potent
factor in promoting our trade with the
Latin-American countries, is not a branch
of the United States Government, but an
international organization in which all the
American republics are represented. It
has its permanent headquarters in Washington,
and the Secretary of State of the
United States is <i>ex officio</i> chairman of its

<p class="dropcap">In his annual report for the year 1918, the Secretary
of Labor declared that “had the Department of
Labor not existed at the beginning of the war, Congress
would have been obliged to create such a department.”
During that year, mainly under the stress of war
conditions, the number of bureaus in this department increased
from four to thirteen, and immense efforts
were put forth by it to promote the smooth
running of industrial machinery at home,
so that the military forces might successfully
prosecute their great task abroad.</p>

<p>In normal times the chief purpose of the
Department is, as stated in the Act creating
it, “to foster, promote and develop the
welfare of the wage-earners of the United
States, to improve their working conditions,
and to advance their opportunities
for profitable employment.” To this end
the Department collects, digests and publishes
statistics and information concerning
labor at home and abroad; supervises
the admission of immigrants into the
country and their naturalization; and aids
in the adjustment of disputes between
workmen and their employers.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting branches of
this Department is known as the Children’s
Bureau. The law provides that
this Bureau “shall investigate and report
upon all matters pertaining to the welfare
of children and child life among all classes
of our people, and shall especially investigate
the questions of infant mortality, the
birth rate, orphanage, juvenile courts,
desertion, dangerous occupations, accidents
and diseases of children, employment,
and legislation affecting children in
the several states and territories.” The
Children’s Bureau has been especially
identified with efforts to secure effective
laws restricting child labor, and it furnished
the machinery for administering the
United States Child-Labor Law which
went into operation September 1, 1917,
only to be set aside the following June,
when it was pronounced unconstitutional
by the United States Supreme Court. The
Court unanimously agreed, however, that
child labor is an evil, and Federal legislation
on this important subject not inconsistent
with the Constitution will doubtless
be eventually enacted.</p>

<p>A notable development of the war was
the United States Employment Service.
The Department of Labor had previously
maintained an employment service in a
small way under the Bureau of Immigration
for the purpose of helping newly-arrived immigrants
to find work. During the war this
expanded into a vast organization for mobilizing
the labor resources of the country.
About eight hundred public employment
exchanges were opened, and labor
was moved from place to place as required,
whether for war industries, for harvesting
the crops, or for other purposes. During
the year 1918 nearly two million wage-earners
were placed by this service in positions
for which they were qualified and in
which their services were needed. After
the armistice an important branch of the
work consisted in finding positions for
discharged soldiers. As a means of recruiting
workers for the industries of the country
and helping solve the problem of unemployment,
this service is one of the most
promising undertakings of the Government,
but its future depends upon further
legislation by Congress.</p>

<p>During the last year before the war
began in Europe the number of immigrants
admitted to the United States was 1,218,480.
The laws relating to immigration and
the Chinese-exclusion laws are administered
by a branch of the Department of
Labor known as the Bureau of Immigration.
Immigration stations are maintained
at the principal seaports, where
physical, mental and moral defectives, as
well as persons likely to become public
charges or afflicted with contagious diseases,
polygamists, anarchists, contract
laborers and Chinese are eliminated. The
most important immigration station is at
Ellis Island, in New York Harbor.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Naturalization, besides
supervising the work of the courts in naturalizing
aliens, is in charge of an extensive
campaign of educating and Americanizing
prospective citizens.</p>

<p class="dropcap">In the year 1790 there were 75 postoffices in
the United States. In 1918 there were 54,345.
The number of pieces of mail handled in a year
approximates twenty million. In order to operate
this vast business enterprise Uncle Sam requires the services
of 300,000 people.</p>

<p>The Postoffice Department, constant in
service, day and night, probably has no
rival among Government institutions. In
1863 the free delivery of mail was undertaken
in half a hundred cities, with 449
carriers. In 1918 there were 2,000 city delivery
offices, with 35,000 carriers. The first
rural free delivery routes, three in number,
were established as an experiment in 1896.
There are now considerably more than a
million miles of such routes, employing
over forty thousand carriers. Special delivery
service was established in 1885. In
an average year the number of pieces of
mail handled by special delivery approximates
fifty million. In 1865 there were 419
money-order offices and the money orders
issued amounted to $1,360,122. In 1918
only a very small percentage of postoffices
did not issue money orders, and the value
of the orders amounted to $940,575,219.</p>

<p>The postal savings system was begun in
1911. Within six years there were upward
of six thousand postoffices that received
deposits and the amount to the credit of
depositors was nearly $150,000,000. The
smallest deposit accepted is $1, but smaller
amounts may be saved by purchasing a
10-cent savings card and affixing 10-cent
savings stamps. Interest is allowed at the
rate of 2 per cent.</p>

<p>The parcel post system dates from 1913.
It has gradually been made more serviceable
to the public by the removal of restrictions
regarding the size, weight, packing
and nature of shipments and by the
increased use of motor vehicles. The
Department estimates that 3,000,000,000
parcels were handled in 1918.</p>

<p>On May 15, 1918, the first regular air
mail route was established in this country
between Washington, Philadelphia and
New York. The flight between Washington
and New York requires approximately
two hours, as compared with five hours by
the fastest railway trains. Other routes
are in course of development.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the World War
the Postoffice Department operated the
telegraph and telephone systems of the
country.</p>

<p>In the year 1918 the Department inaugurated
a system of motor-truck parcel post
routes, especially to facilitate the distribution
of food stuffs. The trucks are owned
by the Government and many former
Army trucks are now utilized in this
service. A great variety of merchandize is
hauled along these routes; all sorts of farm
products are carried to the city markets
and the merchandize purchased in the
city is distributed through the rural districts
on the return trip. The trucks pick
up parcels anywhere along their routes&mdash;not
merely at postoffices, but at farmhouses&mdash;and
deliver in the same way.
Produce from the country is delivered
directly to the consignee in the city, house-to-house
delivery being made wherever the
houses are easily accessible to the regular
routes of the trucks. While certain produce
cannot be shipped through a postoffice,
under the postal regulations, all
kinds of produce, including live poultry,
are accepted by the trucks where the delivery
can be made directly without having to
go through a postoffice.</p>

<p>Besides these routes operated directly
by the Government, many of the so-called
“star routes” (routes operated by
contractors) are now equipped with motor
vehicles.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Although the United States Government has been
conspicuously backward, as compared with foreign
Governments, in providing retirement allowances for
its veteran civilian employees, it has generally made
liberal provision for those who have served in the Army and
the Navy, and especially for the veterans of the various wars
in which the country has been engaged.
In fact, in the payment of pensions to
former soldiers and sailors, and their families,
not only as compensation for wounds
or other disabilities incurred in the service,
but also as a reward for brief participation
in a war, this country has carried liberality
to an extreme not approached by any other
nation. The Revolutionary War cost the
United States about $70,000,000 in pensions,
and every subsequent war, except
the recent world struggle, has added to the
pension roll, which reached its high-water
mark in the year 1905, with a total of
998,441 pensioners, while the annual payments
rose to a maximum of $174,171,661
in 1913. The Pension Office is still one of
the largest and busiest establishments of
the Government, although our latest war
added practically nothing to its labors.</p>

<p>Shortly after the World War began, and
long before the United States became a
participator, Congress established a new
office under the Treasury Department
known as the Bureau of War Risk Insurance,
for the purpose of insuring American
vessels and their cargoes against the risks
of war. In June, 1917, the Government
provided insurance for the officers and
crews of such vessels. Finally, in October,
1917, the Bureau of War Risk Insurance
became the agency for a vast scheme of
protection and compensation afforded to
the soldiers and sailors of the United
States and their families&mdash;a substitute for
the old plan of war pensions. Under the
new plan three forms of financial aid were
rendered, as follows:</p>

<p>1. <i>Allotments and Allowances.</i> Every
enlisted man was required to allot at least
$15 a month from his pay to his wife and
children and other dependents. To this
amount the Government added family
allowances, up to a maximum of $50 a
month.</p>

<p>2. <i>Compensation for Death or Disability.</i>
This applies to officers and enlisted men
alike, and is the same for all ranks, but
varies with the size of the soldier’s or
sailor’s family. A bachelor, without dependents,
gets $30 a month for total disability
incurred in the war, while a married
man with three or more children may
receive as much as $75 a month. The disabled
veteran is also entitled to free medical
and hospital service, artificial limbs,
et cetera. In case of death resulting from
injury in the line of duty, the widow and
family receive monthly allowances.</p>

<p>3. <i>Government Insurance.</i> During the
war all persons in the military and naval
services were granted the privilege of taking
out insurance against death or total
disability (whether due to war service or
otherwise) up to the amount of $10,000, at
a very low cost. This was entirely distinct
from and in addition to the compensation
provided as mentioned in the foregoing
paragraph. The war insurance runs
for a period of five years after the war, and
may then be converted into any of the
ordinary forms of insurance offered by
commercial companies, without medical
examination. Up to July 1, 1918, the
Government received 2,579,912 applications
for insurance under this novel plan,
representing $21,640,065,000 of insurance&mdash;an
amount about equal to that carried
by all the insurance companies of the
United States. In some regiments every
man was insured for $10,000, the maximum
amount allowed.</p>

<p>The Bureau of War Risk Insurance occupies
a magnificent new building in
Washington and has about 15,000 employees.</p>

<p>Besides making these liberal provisions
for the relief of its disabled soldiers and
sailors, the Government has embarked
upon elaborate measures for restoring
them to health and efficiency. They are not
only given the best medical and physical
treatment known to science, but also taught
various trades and occupations, suited to
their condition and natural aptitudes.
During the period of treatment and training
they receive an allowance for the support of
themselves and their families. The Army
and Navy, the Public Health Service, the
Federal Board for Vocational Education
and the Bureau of War Risk Insurance all
take part in this paternal enterprise.</p>

<p class="dropcap">On an April day in 1865, a poor old colored woman was walking
through the streets of Richmond wringing her hands and
moaning, “Oh, Sam’s dead; Sam’s dead!” “What Sam’s
dead, Aunty?” asked a passerby. “Oh, Lord, Uncle Sam!”
It was the death of Abraham Lincoln for which that faithful
heart was grieving. He was her Uncle Sam, the representative
in human form of America, particularly of the Government at Washington,
that mid-point of the strong, and protection of the weak. Yet after all she
missed the great idea that whoever dies and whoever lives, Uncle Sam is eternal;
for Uncle Sam is the American people governing itself. He is the emblem
of the force and courage and resolution of the United States of America.</p>


<h3><i>The Birth of Uncle Sam</i></h3>

<p>Among the names by which American heroes and popular figures have
been called, how did Uncle Sam come to be adopted as the national denominator?
As well ask why Americans were called Yankees, long before the
Revolution, or why “Yanks” has been the name applied by Allied soldiers
to the forces of the United States in the European battlefields, and has
been accepted by regiments from North and South alike. As well try to
run down the first use of “Brother Jonathan,” in much the same sense as
that in which we now employ “Uncle Sam.” Learned men and some of
the unlearned have delved deep to find the origin of the term Uncle Sam,
and the significance of his out-of-style clothes.</p>

<p>One school of these explorers has presumed to trace Uncle Sam back
to an obscure Samuel Wilson, who during the War of 1812 was engaged
in a government contract for beef and pork to feed the United States army.
Nobody mentioned this yarn until thirty years later, when Jack Frost in
his <i>Book of the Navy</i> gave it currency, without stating where he found
what he himself calls “a silly joke.” Frost asserts that from casks marked
“U. S.” by Samuel Wilson, the idea was taken by the soldiers, and that
gradually it spread through the army
and the nation.</p>

<p class="caption">AN EARLY PORTRAYAL OF UNCLE SAM</p>

<p class="caption">A reproduction of the title page of the first illustrated
comic paper in the United States, 1846</p>
</div>

<p>The only facts that can be ascertained
on this subject are that in 1813
there was a firm of meat packers at
Troy, in which Samuel Wilson was a
partner. Then that on September 7,
1813, the Troy <i>Post</i> printed an article
containing the expression “Loss upon
loss, and no ill luck … except what
lights upon UNCLE SAM’S shoulders.”
A note in the newspaper goes
on to say “This cant name for our
government has got almost as current
as ‘John Bull.’ The letters ‘U. S.’ on
the government wagons, etc., are supposed
to have given rise to it.” A
month later another paper commented
on the number of deserters in the
army, adding “The pretence is, that
<i>Uncle Sam</i>, a now popular explication of the U. S., does not pay well.”</p>

<p>Three or four years later, other newspapers, who appeared to have no
knowledge of Samuel Wilson, made the far more probable explanation
that the term Uncle Sam was simply taken from the letters “U. S.” on
soldiers’ caps and knapsacks. Even the Indians accepted the new term,
and when President Madison was at the northern front asked the privilege
“to shake hands with Uncle Sam.”<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Note&mdash;We have the word of one searcher that as early as 1807 a regiment of Light Dragoons was raised whose
initials, “U. S. L. D.,” on wagons and accouterment were waggishly interpreted to mean “Uncle Sam’s Lazy Dogs.”</p></div>

<p>Uncle Sam’s clothes, like the Quaker dress, were not invented to be
humorous, but as the fashionable costume of the period when Quakers’ and
Uncle Sam’s began to appear. Trousers with straps under the insteps were
still worn down to fifty years ago. In the days when the striped cotton
trousers of the French soldiers began to drive out the old-fashioned knee
breeches, Uncle Sam came by his lower protection naturally. The broad-brimmed
beaver hat, till very recently, could be seen on the heads of wealthy
Quaker bankers in Philadelphia.
The star-spangled coats and
correctly flag-striped trousers
are of course the inventions
of later patriotic times.</p>

<h3><i>What Does Uncle Sam
Do for His Nephews
and Nieces?</i></h3>

<p>The great thing about
Uncle Sam is his dignity,
activity, keenness, endless good
nature and love of his countrymen.
His cousin, John Bull,
is the beefy, sturdy, pragmatic,
land-owning squire of the British counties, brave enough, resolute enough, but
a defender of his country, rather than its most intimate friend. Uncle Sam
and the popular interest in his thousands of portraits are standing proofs
of the common sense and good temper of the American people. We like
in Uncle Sam what we like in our personal Uncle Ezra, or Uncle Peyton,
his genuine, affectionate, thoughtful and protecting affection for us.</p>

<p>The three men in American history who have most nearly corresponded
to Uncle Sam in their own personal relations with their fellow men were
Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. Jackson
was testy, and sharp tempered, but he could be very genial and gallant
when he chose. Lincoln was the Uncle Abe of the nation; in person, in
speech, in action, and above all in his great affectionate heart he was what
we like to think Uncle Sam is. Theodore Roosevelt was not so much
uncle as brother; there is only one “T. R.” in our history!</p>

<p class="caption">EXHIBIT OF UNITED STATES BUREAU OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC
COMMERCE</p>
</div>

<p>In the popular
thought Uncle Sam is
ourselves at our best;
or rather he is ourselves
gathered up into
one body, one agency,
one force. Uncle Sam
stamps his initials on
the public buildings,
the camps, the stores,
the guns, the ships, the
uniforms, the army
wagons, and the army
mules. Uncle Sam
carries the mails, prints
the greenbacks, sends
the seeds, digs the
canals, lays the taxes, enlists the soldiers, fights
the war and makes the peace. Uncle Sam is
the national Santa Claus, the trimmer of
America’s Christmas tree, the free mail-order
establishment, the ready subscriber to all good
causes. In a way, Uncle Sam means the
Government of the United States&mdash;more accurately
he stands for the human side of the
Government, interested in the people, eager
that they should be happy, warding off dangers
immediate and far away. Uncle Sam rocked
the cradle of the republic and watches over it
with pride, just as the wealthy and generous
uncle in ordinary family life looks after a high-spirited
bouncing niece.</p>

<p>To come down to more precise and commonplace
terms, what does the great Government
of the United States, centered in
Washington, do for the people of the United
States? The moment we attempt to make a
list of his benefits we discover that they outrun
the capacity of any human comparison.
The United States Government is more like a telephone exchange, with
direct wires to every hamlet and household. It is like a vast school with
many class rooms in which are taught various branches of the same subject,
namely how to make the United States citizens happier, better and
more prosperous. Out of the many radiations from this central influence,
let us select a few of those in which the benevolent side of our Government
is more clearly presented. For instance, let us see what the Government
does for such matters as education, labor, agriculture, commerce, and the
carrying of intelligence,
for the defense of the
community, and protection
of free institutions
here and elsewhere
in the world.</p>

<h3><i>Uncle Sam’s Schools</i></h3>

<p>For many years
Uncle Sam left to the
people at large the task
of educating young people,
except the future
officers of the United
States army and much
later of the navy.
These schools have been kept
up, enlarged and provided with
magnificent buildings; and
they trained nearly all the officers
in high command during
the world war in both army
and navy. In the course of
the war the number of cadets
was much increased; but it
was found necessary hastily to
set up special officers’ schools
and training corps in various
parts of the country. The
United States also takes part
in the public education of the
states in a variety of ways. It
has given to the states for common schools about 80 million acres of land,
and for agricultural colleges and similar purposes about 15 million more.
Ever since 1887 it has made also money grants to state agricultural colleges
for experiment stations; and by the recent Smith-Hughes act is preparing
to spend millions for vocational instruction, including farming. The states
are obliged to put up an equal amount for the same purpose. Other bills
look forward to a larger expenditure which would aid the states to get
rid of the deplorable illiteracy found in some
of them. Uncle Sam maintains schools in
the dependencies&mdash;the Philippines, Hawaii,
Porto Rico, etc.; and the Bureau of Education
in Washington is a kind of center
and clearing house of information and
activity in education of every kind.</p>

<h3><i>Uncle Sam as an Employer of Labor</i></h3>

<p>By far the largest employer of labor
within the United States is Uncle Sam
himself, who had, about the time when
America entered the war in 1917, 520,000
employees in the civil service, besides near
150,000 soldiers and sailors. Besides thus
furnishing a livelihood to one person in a
hundred and fifty of the whole population
of the United States, the Government carries
on a Bureau of Labor, which gets
together all kinds of information about labor
conditions in this country and in other
countries. In 1916, the Government passed
a special statute for settling the troubles
between the railroad
men and the railroads,
commonly called the
“Adamson Bill,” under
which a strike was
averted and wages
were raised.</p>

Driver, Assist. Postmaster, Clerk, and Delivery Messenger</p>
</div>

<p>During the war, a
National War Labor
Board was set up to
adjust troubles between
employers and
their hands working in
munitions factories
and other war industries; and many serious difficulties were settled by
this official arbitration board. Thousands of workmen and workwomen
of every degree of skill were drawn into the war service of the Government,
as clerks, as workers in factories, and in many other capacities.</p>

<p>Up to the time of the war, the Government was much opposed to allowing
its employees to join in trades unions, but when, in 1917, the railroads
and later the telegraph and telephone operatives were transferred to Government
control, they carried with them their existing unions, and even
formed some new ones. Uncle Sam therefore takes a large responsibility
for labor conditions both inside and outside of the Government service.</p>


<h3><i>Uncle Sam as a Farmer</i></h3>

<p>Although farming was the main pursuit of the American people when
Uncle Sam first appeared on the scene, and although 33 per cent. of the
workers in the country are today busy on farms, it was many years before
the Government of the United States aided the agriculturalist. It began
with printed reports (which, oddly enough, were issued by the Patent
Office) on improved breeds of
farm animals, with attractive
colored lithographs. The immense
Morrill Land Grant of
1862 was intended chiefly for
agricultural education, and
the students and graduates of
the resulting colleges have
done much to spread a knowledge
of scientific farming, such
as the adaptation of crops to
soil, improvement of seeds and
grains, the development of
high-grade cattle and other
farm animals, and the protection of fruit and other crops from insect pests.</p>

<p>In 1889 was established a Department of Agriculture, with a Secretary
sitting in the Cabinet; and in the thirty years that have followed the
Department has wonderfully expanded its usefulness. For instance, it has
discovered the cause of the Texas cattle fever, which turned out to be a
tick, and has very nearly put an end to that dangerous and destructive
pest; it has found a serum to prevent hog cholera; it has established a
system for checking the ravages of tuberculosis in cattle; its Bureau of
Plant Industry brings in new seeds and fruits from all over the world&mdash;including
such valuable varieties as the Durum wheat from Russia, Siberian
millet and Egyptian dates.</p>

<p>Closely allied with the work
of the Department of Agriculture
is the irrigation service, which is
reclaiming millions of acres of
land otherwise useless, by furnishing
it with unfailing water.
The National Forests are under
the direction of the Department
of Agriculture, which employs
about two thousand rangers and
fire look-outs.<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> The Biological
Survey has successfully found
methods for destroying the rats,
chipmunks, mice and ground squirrels which cause losses of many millions
to the farmers. Millions of copies of printed circulars and pamphlets on
various phases of farming are printed. No agency of the Government
reaches so great a number of the active workers and producers of the land.</p>

<h3><i>Uncle Sam in Trade</i></h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus07b.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A SEASHORE MAIL ROUTE ON THE PACIFIC COAST</p>
</div>

<p>Besides their agriculture, our forefathers always pushed shipping and
trade. They were keen on the Indian fur trade, and produced salt meats,
grain “naval stores,” (pitch, tar and turpentine), potashes and pearl ashes,
timber, and other things,
and sold them to European
countries. In return they
imported calicoes and “oznabrigs”
(which were a kind of
linen) “paduasoy” (which
was Italian silk), hardware,
guns, tools, china, and the
rich cloths, velvets and satins
which Colonial gentlemen
delighted to wear. When the
United States came into being
as a Government, it paid very
little attention to commerce,
leaving the merchants free to
develop their trade with all
parts of the world.</p>

<p>It is only in recent years
that Uncle Sam has realized
how he can help the merchant,
the shipper and the vessel
owner. Not until 1903 was
there an office at Washington
charged with the duty to
“promote foreign and domestic
commerce.” Not till 1913
was there a distinct Department of Commerce, within which were grouped
some of the most important services rendered by the nation to its people.
For example, commerce includes such varied services as lighthouses,
steamboat inspection, fisheries, navigation, and the coast survey. In
addition the Department of Commerce comes very near to the complicated
organization of the business of the country, through its Bureau of
Corporations, Bureau of Standards of Weights and Measures, and Bureau
of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, as well as the Census Bureau, which
collects a variety of statistics.</p>

<p>During the war, Uncle Sam stretched out his long arm still farther
into the trade and business of the country, and appointed a Director of
Railroads to take control of most of the railroad lines in the land. It was
that Board which made possible the conveyance of the enormous quantities
of stores and munitions which supplied our armies in France.
Going still farther,
Uncle Sam took up the
ship carpenter’s axe,
the caulker’s mallet,
and the riveter’s electric
machine. All the
ship yards in the country
were brought under
the control and direction
of the Government.</p>

<p>The Post Office has
been Uncle Sam’s
peculiar interest ever
since the Federal Government
was founded;
and he pushes that
business ever farther
and farther. The letter, the newspaper, the book
and the package, are sent flying from one of the
long arms of Uncle Sam to another, till the business
has come to total over three hundred million dollars
a year. The registry service, special delivery
system, and especially the parcel post, bring new
conveniences, and new proofs of our Uncle’s desire
to be useful. In the course of the war the whole
system of telegraphs also was taken over. Many
lines of business, especially the newspaper and periodical
publishers, the mail-order houses, and the
advertisers are dependent upon this field of Government
operation.</p>

<h3><i>Uncle Sam as a Watchman</i></h3>

<p>Most of all in times of danger and distress do
we turn eagerly to that multiple of ourselves,
which we call Uncle Sam. In the most peaceful
days the sailor in blue or the soldier in khaki stood behind the courts
and the laws and the policemen. When rioters and anarchists raised
their heads they knew that Uncle Sam was drawn up around the corner,
and would stop them whenever they passed from noisy words to desperate
deeds. “U. S.” is the trench line which protects this country from invasion.
“U. S.” builds the forts, works out plans of harbor defence, keeps
powerful ships in commission, and raises, clothes,
equips, feeds, and pays
the armies which are the
clenched fists of the nation.
Other governments, state,
municipal and local, offer
many benefits, but Uncle
Sam is the only American
known to foreign nations
as the creator of armies and
the fighter of battles.</p>

<p>The mystic two letters
“U. S.” which are the emblems
within the United
States of peace and protection,
became known in
the World War far across
the seas in many lands.
Disturbed and broken nations
welcome occupation
by United States troops,
because they have learned
that Uncle Sam is both strong
and merciful; that he hits his
enemies hard; but raises up
and saves the noncombatant,
the neutral and the vanquished.
Never has the reputation
of the United States
of America stood so high as a
stalwart, resolute and unflinching
power which puts
out its wealth like water, and
enlists its man-power by millions, when war must be fought. Never
has the Uncle Sam conception of the great North American federation
been so clear and so welcome in the minds of other peoples; what
can any nation ask that is better and higher than to be hailed as
the defender of civilization against the most furious blows; and at
the same time as the friend, ally and protector of men of good will
wherever found throughout the world? “U. S.” to hammer the Hun;
“Uncle Sam” to succor the Belgians and French, to aid the Armenian
and the Greek, as the friend of mankind.</p>

<p>In addition to the vast work of reclaiming desert lands, protecting
forests, and improving rivers, harbors and canals, Uncle Sam has spent
millions of dollars in opening up to the people great natural wonder
realms of the country and putting them in order for outdoor pleasure
grounds. Four National
Parks&mdash;the Yellowstone, the
Yosemite, Glacier National
Park and Rainier National
Park have already been
treated in individual numbers
of The Mentor, and
future issues will be devoted
to others of these magnificent
public domains. The
Grand Canyon, to which a
Mentor number has also
been given, is not one of the
National Parks, but is a Reserve
set apart for all time
by the Government.</p>

and wisdom of Uncle Sam there
have been preserved for the American
people the prehistoric dwellings of
extinct races in Arizona and Colorado.
Rocky Mountain Park, Colorado, and
Crater National Park, southern Oregon,
attract thousands of visitors
annually. Every summer, innumerable
groups of Nature lovers camp and
tramp in the Government forest parks of California. In all, there are
now (1919) sixteen National Parks in the United States and Alaska, with
a total area of nearly 10,000 square miles. In 1916 a National Park was
also created in the territory of Hawaii, with an area of 75,295 acres.</p>

<p>To many of us, perhaps, Uncle Sam’s Government may appear to
consist of a vast number of men using up time and money in doing a
great many things in which we see no useful purpose whatever. Other
men in the Legislative Department appear to be discussing at great length
the framing of new laws, good, bad or indifferent, and we criticize them
accordingly. The thought that we can capitalize our citizenship in a most
valuable material way and
that we can make direct personal
use of the Government,
whatever our calling in life
may be, few of us have ever
realized. We have pointed
out some of the ways in
which Uncle Sam helps his
relatives. Whatever your
chosen work may be, whatever
your interest may be,
turn to Uncle Sam and learn
how valuable a friend and support
he can be.</p>

<h2><i>THE OPEN LETTER</i></h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 243px;">
<img src="images/illus12.jpg" width="243" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SAM SLICK</p>

<p class="caption">Judge Haliburton’s original Yankee character</p>
</div>

<p>The true origin of the character of
“Uncle Sam” is a matter of doubt. The
figure has been a familiar one in the history
of the United States for many years,
but the actual date of its first appearance
is not known. As a little school girl once
wrote in her essay on Ancient Rome,
“its origin is wrapped
in antiquity.” It appears
that “Uncle Sam”
emerged from the soil
and began to materialize
into definite form about
one hundred years ago.
A favored theory concerning
the origin of the
tall, lean, Yankee figure
type is that he owes his
peculiar identity to a
character created by
Judge Thomas Haliburton,
and known in literature
as “Sam Slick.”
Oddly enough, the creator&mdash;if
we may call him
so&mdash;of the figure that
now stands for the national
type, was not himself
an American. Judge
Thomas Haliburton was
born in Windsor, Nova
Scotia, in December,
1796. He was a successful
lawyer, and occasionally
took a turn at literature.
In 1835 there appeared in a Halifax journal
a series of papers which were afterwards
issued in book form under the title, “The
Clock-Maker, or the Sayings and Doings
of Sam Slick.” In this and in a later book
“Nature and Human Nature,” the author
pictured an acute, good-tempered Yankee
who was a native of the state of Connecticut&mdash;the
state of which Jonathan
Trumbull, the original “Brother Jonathan,”
was governor. Haliburton described
Sam Slick as “a tall, thin man
with hollow cheeks and bright, twinkling,
black eyes.” As he sold his Yankee clocks
he was supposed to meet on the road a
“squire” who traveled some distance with
him and found entertainment in Sam’s
“down-east talk and shrewd Americanisms.”
In England, where the book had a
wide sale, Sam Slick came to be accepted as
the symbolic American in speech, appearance
and thought.</p>

<p>The <i>London Times</i> of November 27,
1840, said: “No modern book can give
better insight into the politics, prejudices,
manners and actions of the inhabitants of
the United States than this.” Another
English critic found Sam Slick “a knowing
individual, sensible, sagacious, not without
tact, and overflowing
with humor.” According
to Sam, “Push-on&mdash;keep
movin’&mdash;go
ahead,” was the maxim
of the States. He described
the typical American
as “the chap with
speed, wind and bottom;
clear grit, ginger to the
backbone, spry as a fox,
supple as an eel.”</p>

<p>The illustrators of Sam
Slick made him lean,
smiling, and in all respects
a contrast to the
heavy-set John Bull.
They put on his head the
high hat and clothed him
in the long-tailed coat
and striped trousers
that Uncle Sam still
wears. “We call the
American public ‘Uncle
Sam,’” declared Sam Slick
to the Squire, “as you
call the British ‘John
Bull.’” Sam’s humor was
called “the sunny side of common sense.”</p>

<p>“The Clock-Maker” ran into fifty editions
and was as popular in America and
in Canada as in England&mdash;it also had many
readers in France. So potent was the delineation
of the Yankee, Sam Slick, that it
established and still influences the foreign
estimate of citizens of the United States.
Judge Haliburton had a distinguished
career, the latter part of which was passed
in England&mdash;where he died in 1865.</p>

<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>We can see from the foregoing that
there is some reason, then, for the claim
of certain chroniclers that “Sam Slick”
was the original Yankee character, and
that Windsor, Nova Scotia, was the
birthplace of the oddly-costumed figure
that now stands for the shrewd, benevolent,
wide-awake and efficient personality
that we call
“Uncle Sam.”</p>

<h2>The Service of Uncle Sam</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-fancy-a.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">All of us know that Uncle Sam means well by the hundred million members
of his family, but few have any adequate appreciation of the many varied
forms in which Uncle Sam lends a helping hand. His service is apparent
everywhere in city, town, village and farm&mdash;and in the great desert
wastes and mountain heights. It is worth while to take a sweeping
survey of the whole field of Uncle Sam’s helpful operations:</p>

<p>HELPING THE FARMER. Uncle Sam supplies a wealth of information about
the planting and growing of crops, with crop estimates and statistics of agriculture.
He supplies weather reports and gives helpful information on the control of destructive
insects and birds&mdash;also on the fostering and improving of live stock. He gives advice
on forest lands and forest fire protection. He helps in building rural roads and assists
in farm management and in the procuring of farm help. He advises the farmer in
marketing and in rural organization and farm finance. He gives information concerning
diseases prevalent in rural districts. He supplies courses of reading for farmer
parents, and assists in the work of rural schools. He spends large sums of money in
administration work in the Department of Agriculture to help the condition of the
farmer, the farmer’s wife and the girls and boys on the farm. He directs their education
and shows them how to improve their living conditions. His office of information
supplies documents full of valuable practical suggestions for the farmer.</p>

<p>HELPING THE SETTLER. Uncle Sam reclaims desert lands and places them
at the disposal of settlers. He encourages the establishment of homesteads and conducts
forest service and geological surveys to develop land and make it valuable.</p>

<p>HELPING THE BUSINESS MAN. Uncle Sam gives assistance and information
to almost all businesses&mdash;and carries on, at enormous expense, special work for the
Mining, Fishing, Fur, Lumber and Shipping Industries. He pursues scientific experiments
with agricultural products and develops water power for commercial use. He
protects the business man with the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve
Board, and the Interstate Commerce Commission.</p>

<p>HELPING THE WORKING MAN. In the Department of Labor a vast amount
of Service is devoted to securing employment for laborers, supplying information concerning
labor conditions, pursuing practical investigations for the safety and health of
the working men. He acts as a community organizer, advising and supervising, and
is a mediator in disputes on labor questions.</p>

<p>HELPING THE IMMIGRANT. He greets the immigrant with an intelligent
and careful scrutiny as to his health and general welfare. He opens the eyes of the
immigrant to his opportunities in the United States, and helps him to get employment.
He instills in him ideals of industry, integrity, and good citizenship.</p>

<p>HELPING THE NEGRO. Uncle Sam supplies statistics and detailed reports
concerning the education of the Negro. He gives assistance to the Negro farmer,
instruction to the Negro woman and children in home economics and in school and
home gardening.</p>

<p>HELPING IN THE HOME. Uncle Sam pursues investigations and gives advice
concerning the practical problems of the home. He is ever inspecting foods, drugs,
meats and the quality of milk and water. He will permit no foul or tainted food or
drink to reach the mouth of the mother or children. He carries on an employment
bureau of service, giving information and advice. In the lives of children Uncle Sam’s
helping hand is ever to be found. He prepares publications and gives information and
conducts courses for the education of children in all branches of knowledge, stimulating,
particularly, vocational education, in agriculture, and in the trades and industries. For
the protection of children he enforces the Federal Child Labor Act, and to keep them
well and healthy he has devised enticing plans for outdoor occupation in school and
home garden, that they may be sound, healthy and fit for worthy citizenship.</p>

make the most of yourself as a citizen, write to Uncle Sam.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
